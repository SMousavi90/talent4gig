## Reasons of delay

Thing that I've done to prepare my computer for Java Development:

- reinstalling windows because of bugs which was caused by windows insider program and there were some strange errors.
- installing latest version of eclipse.
- installing JBoss on eclipse and its configuration. 
- installing Java 7 because Java 8 is not compatible with JBoss 7.1 and I wasn't sure that I could use Wildfly 8 or not.
